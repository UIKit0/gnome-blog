===Commit Permissions==
Build sherrif commits are welcome.

If you are an experienced GNOME hacker and confident that your code is right,
you don't need maintainer approval to commit to HEAD. 

If you are unsure of your change, please feel free to send the patch to
seth@gnome.org and get our approval so we won't execute you when it breaks 
things / does them wrong.

===Prior to Checkin===
Create a ChangeLog entry

===FIXMEs===
Use "FIXME" to augument code that needs more work, that is missing functionality or
in general needs attention. Include a comprehensive comment explaining what is 
missing, why you think something is broken, what you suggest as a fix, etc.
FIXME entries are periodically converted into bugzilla bugs.
Do not use any other format to draw attention to problems, comments that do
not contain "FIXME" are not going to be found by our problem tracking tools.
